      <h3>Who are we?</h3>
      <p>The Byte Bakery was founded by Jared DiScipio and Ben Smith, who both majored in computer science in college. They both shared a love for baking and coding, and wanted to find a way to incorporate both of these into their work. Thus, the Byte Bakery was born! Mixing themes and imagery from the world of computer science with their sweet pastries, they were able to create niche delicacies that like-minded techies could enjoy.
